ROUND 2 SPONSORED PROBLEM STATEMENT – GUVI 
 
1) Mobile Multiplayer Game Applications for Dementia Prevention and Elderly 
Care 
 
Problem Overview 
 
Dementia and age-related cognitive decline often lead to memory loss, 
reduced mental agility, and social isolation among elderly individuals, especially 
those living alone or in remote locations. Research indicates that regular 
cognitive stimulation combined with social interaction can help slow cognitive 
decline and improve emotional well-being. However, most mobile games today 
are not designed to meet the accessibility, simplicity, and social needs of senior 
citizens. 
 
Challenge 
 
Design and develop a mobile application–based multiplayer game that enables 
elderly users to play together remotely, promoting cognitive health, emotional 
well-being, and social connection. 
 
Objective 
 
Participants must build a mobile multiplayer game app that: 
    •    Enhances cognitive skills such as memory, attention, reasoning, and 
language 
    •    Supports real-time or turn-based multiplayer gameplay for users in 
different locations 
    •    Encourages collaboration and friendly competition 
    •    Is intuitive, accessible, and designed specifically for senior citizens 
 
Key Requirements 
 
The mobile game application should: 
    •    Be developed using React Native for cross-platform support 
    •    Run on Android and/or iOS 
    •    Support real-time or asynchronous multiplayer modes 
    •    Include cooperative or friendly competitive gameplay 
    •    Provide senior-friendly interactions such as voice cues, simple chat, or 
emojis 
    •    Feature large buttons, high-contrast UI, readable fonts, and minimal 
navigation 
    •    Offer adaptive difficulty levels based on individual or group performance 
    •    Ensure secure communication and user data privacy 
    •    Perform reliably on low-bandwidth internet connections 
 
Suggested Tech Stack 
    •    Frontend: React Native 
    •    Backend (optional): Firebase / Node.js / Supabase 
    •    Real-time Communication: WebSockets / Firebase Realtime Database 
    •    Authentication: Simple PIN / OTP-based login 
    •    State Management: Context API / Redux 
(Teams may extend or modify the stack as needed.) 
 
Example Game Ideas (For Reference) 
    1.    Memory Match Together – Multiplayer card-matching game with 
adaptive difficulty 
    2.    Word Recall Circle – Turn-based word association and storytelling game 
    3.    Daily Routine Builder – Cooperative sequencing of familiar daily activities 
    4.    Pattern & Rhythm Sync – Real-time visual or audio pattern repetition 
game 
    5.    Virtual Board Games for Seniors – Simplified classic board games with 
remote multiplayer 
 
Target Users 
 
    •    Elderly individuals (60+) 
    •    Seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
    •    Caregivers, families, and elderly care centers 
 
Constraints 
 
    •    Must be non-medical and non-invasive 
    •    Should be usable by people with limited digital literacy 
    •    Must prioritize accessibility, inclusivity, and safety
